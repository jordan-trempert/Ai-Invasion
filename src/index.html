            <p>Welcome to AI Invasion! This game is based off of DougDoug's ai invasion streams!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Player's will take turns setting the capital for their empire.</li>
                <li>After both players set a capital, they can start making moves.</li>
                <li>A move can be literally anything the player wants. Just type it in the box and hit sumbit!</li>
                <li>The goal is to obtain 24 of the 48 available states.</li>
            </ul>
            <center><h2>AI is stupid so play by these rules:</h2></center>
            <ul>
                <li>Player's can only conquer a state if they own a state adjacent to it.</li>
                <li>The AI will (attempt to) output a scenario based on the player's action. It is up to the players to decided if they succeeded or failed.</li>
                <li>If player's cannot come to a consensus, do a coin flip.</li>
                <li>Each player gets the ability to collect 3 special resources.</li>
                <li>There are two different ways player's can choose to use them:</li>
                <li>1. Player's use one of their turns attempting to collect a resource (this is the preferred play-style).</li>
                <li>2. Each player starts the game with 3 special resources of their choosing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Have fun playing!</p>
